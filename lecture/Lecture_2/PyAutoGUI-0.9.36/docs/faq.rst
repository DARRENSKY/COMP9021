Q: Can PyAutoGUI figure out where windows are or which windows are visible? Can it focus, maximize, minimize windows? Can it read the window titles?

A: Unfortunately not, but these are the next features planned for PyAutoGUI. This functionality is being implemented in a Python package named PyGetWindow, which will be included in PyAutoGUI when complete.


Q: Can PyAutoGUI work on Android, iOS, or tablet/smartphone apps.

A: Unfortunately no. PyAutoGUI only runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
